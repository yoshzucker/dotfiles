Usage:
  pre-commit [--help]

Run leakseek, gitleaks, and Japanese character check before committing.

🪝 How to install as a Git pre-commit hook:

1. Save this script to:
     ~/.local/bin/pre-commit

2. Make sure it's executable:
     chmod +x ~/.local/bin/pre-commit

3. For each Git repository where you want to enable this check, run:
     ln -sf ~/.local/bin/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit

💡 You can also test it manually from anywhere inside the repo:
     pre-commit

🚨 What this script does:
- Runs 'leakseek' from the repo root
- Runs 'gitleaks detect' from the repo root
- Checks for Japanese characters in source files
- If any check fails, the commit is aborted
- If all checks pass, the commit proceeds
